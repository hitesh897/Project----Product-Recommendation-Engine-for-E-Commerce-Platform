# Project----Product-Recommendation-Engine-for-E-Commerce-Platform

They use item-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive datasets and produces high quality recommendation systems in the real time. This system is a kind of an information filtering system which seeks to predict the "rating" or preferences.
