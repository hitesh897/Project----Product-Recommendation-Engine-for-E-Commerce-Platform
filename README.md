# Project----Product-Recommendation-Engine-for-E-Commerce-Platform

E-commerce companies use recommendation systems to provide suggestions to the customers. They use item-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive datasets and produces high quality recommendation systems in the real time. This system is a kind of an information filtering system which seeks to predict the "rating" or preferences which user is interested in.

Attribute Information:

● userId : Every user identified with a unique id

● productId : Every product identified with a unique id

● Rating : Rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user

● timestamp : Time of the rating ( ignore this column for this exercise)


Build a recommendation system based on the given data.
